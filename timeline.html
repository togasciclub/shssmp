								<p><strong> Thursday, June 16: Release of Preliminary Mentor Pairings </strong> <br><br>

									We will release preliminary pairings in which each high school student will be paired with two mentors. This is meant to give students an opportunity to talk to multiple alumni and see who is the best fit. <br><br>
									
									
									<strong>June 18 - June 24: Alumni Open Houses </strong> <br><br>
									
									Each mentor will be holding a 30-minute open house to talk about their major and answer any questions high school students might have. These open houses are available to everyone (even to students who haven’t been assigned to that mentor) to allow people to learn about a variety of majors and hopefully explore some new fields of study. We will release a calendar with all of the open house dates by the end of June 17. <br><br>
									
									
									High school students that would like to work with a college student over the summer MUST attend the open house of the alumni to which they were assigned and stay afterward to discuss the plan for the summer with their mentor. The preliminary pairings are to ensure that the college students know who to look for after the open house to discuss how they can help throughout the summer.<br><br>
									
									
									<strong>June 23: Final Preference Forms Due </strong> <br><br>
									
									We will be sending out a preference form before the open houses begin. After students have had a chance to meet and talk with their two mentors, they can specify which mentor they would like to work with for the rest of the summer. <br><br>
									
									
									Unfortunately, due to constraints on mentors’ time, we will not necessarily be able to give students their first choice. However, all our mentors have graciously offered to help high school students learn more about college and this is a great opportunity regardless of which mentor a student ends up working with. <br><br>
									
									
									<strong>June 25 - : Mentorship</strong> <br><br>
									
									In order to keep the program running, we will have mentors meet with their students for at least 20 minutes each week to answer any questions, give advice, or simply talk. Students should be respectful to the mentors’ time and prepare questions or have assigned work prepared by the meeting time decided by their mentor. Mentors may also decide to meet more than once a week. <br><br>
